# Implementation-of-Decision-Tree-Classifier-Model-for-Predicting-Employee-Churn

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Classifier Model for Predicting Employee Churn.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm:
1.Import the libraries and read the data frame using pandas.

2.Calculate the null values from dataframe and apply label encoder.

3.Apply decision tree classifier on the dataframe.

4.obtain the value of accuracy and data prediction.

## Program:
```
